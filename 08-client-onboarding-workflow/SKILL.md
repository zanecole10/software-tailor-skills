# Client Onboarding Workflow Builder

First impressions matter. Professional onboarding = confident clients.

## What This Skill Does

Input your service â†’ Get complete onboarding system:
âœ… **Welcome Email Sequence** - Automated client welcome
âœ… **Information Gathering Forms** - Collect requirements systematically

## Onboarding Timeline

- Access credentials (if needed)

**Day 4-5: Kickoff Meeting (60 min)**
- Review questionnaire responses
- Clarify requirements
- Set expectations
- Introduce tools/process

**Day 6: Send Requirements Doc**
- Formalized version of what you're building
- Client reviews and approves
- Prevents "but I thought you were building..." later

**Week 2-6: Weekly Updates**

- Reduces "how's it going?" interruptions

## Kickoff Meeting Agenda

**1. Introductions (5 min)**
- Build rapport
- Set casual, collaborative tone

**2. Review Project Goals (10 min)**
- "What does success look like for you?"
- Confirm you understand the problem

**3. Walk Through Questionnaire (20 min)**
- Clarify unclear responses
- Ask follow-up questions
- Sketch workflows on screen share

**4. Set Expectations (10 min)**
- Timeline and milestones
- Communication cadence
- How to request changes

**5. Technical Setup (10 min)**
- Exchange access credentials
- Set up tools (GitHub, staging site)
- Test communication channels

**6. Next Steps (5 min)**
- You: Send requirements doc by Tuesday
- Them: Review and approve by Friday
- You: Start development next Monday

## Why This Works

**Without onboarding:** Client feels uncertain, interrupts you constantly, changes mind mid-project

**With onboarding:** Client feels confident, trusts the process, stays out of your way while you build

Professional onboarding = fewer headaches = faster delivery = happier clients.
