# Software Demonstration Script

The demo is where you justify your $15K price. Present like a pro.

## What This Skill Does

Input: Software you built
Output: **Demo script** with walkthrough, wow moments, objection handling, closing transition

## Demo Structure (The Hollywood Formula)

**Act 1: The Setup (2 min)**
- Show the old way (painful)
- Transition: "Now watch this..."

**Act 2: The Transformation (8-10 min)**
- Walk through key workflows
- Highlight time savings at each step
- "See how this used to take 2 hours? Now it's 30 seconds."

**Act 3: The Wow Moment (2 min)**
- The one feature that makes them say "Holy shit"
- Example: Click button → Perfect PDF report generated instantly
- "Remember spending an hour creating this report manually?"

**Act 4: The Business Impact (3 min)**
- Translate features into dollars saved
- Show ROI calculation
- "This saves your team 220 hours/month = $6,600/month = $79K/year"

**Act 5: The Close (2 min)**
- "Questions?"
- Handle objections
- "Ready to get started?"

## Demo Rules

**DO:**
- ✅ Use real/realistic data (not "Test User" and "Sample Inc")
- ✅ Narrate what you're doing ("I'm clicking Schedule Inspection...")
- ✅ Pause for reaction after wow moments
- ✅ Connect every feature to their pain points
- ✅ Have client drive part of demo ("You try it - click that button")

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Apologize for UI ("Sorry this looks rough...")
- ❌ Show bugs or incomplete features
- ❌ Rush through - let them absorb
- ❌ Get technical ("This uses PostgreSQL...")
- ❌ Demo features they don't care about

## Handling Objections During Demo

**"This looks complicated"**
→ "I get it - lots of features. But 90% of the time you'll just use these 3 screens. Let me show you the daily workflow..."

**"Can it do [Feature X]?"**
→ If yes: "Absolutely, let me show you..."
→ If no but easy: "Not yet, but I can add that in Phase 2 for $[X]. Want me to quote that?"
→ If no and hard: "That's outside this scope, but tell me more about that need..."

**"Our team won't use this"**
→ "Fair concern. This is designed to be simpler than what you're doing now. Your team clicks 3 buttons instead of managing Excel. Plus I'll train them personally."

## The Transition to Close

After demo: "So, what do you think?"

**If they love it:**
"Great! Here's how we get started: I'll send the contract today, you sign and send the 50% deposit ($9K), and I'll have this live for you in 6 weeks. Sound good?"

**If they're hesitant:**
"What concerns do you have?" (Address directly)

**If they need to "think about it":**
"Of course. What specifically do you need to think about? Budget? Features? Timeline?" (Uncover real objection)

## Remember

Demos don't sell features - they sell **transformation**.

Before: Chaos, wasted time, frustration
After: Organized, automated, relief

Show them the future. Make them feel it. Close the deal.
