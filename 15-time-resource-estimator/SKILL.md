# Time & Resource Estimator

Stop over-promising. Deliver on time with realistic estimates.

## What This Skill Does

Input: Project scope and features
Output: Realistic timeline, hour breakdown, buffer calculations, client communication

## Estimation Framework

### Base Hours by Feature Type

**Authentication & User Management:** 6-8 hours
- Login/signup
- Password reset
- User roles
- Session management

**CRUD Operations (per model):** 4-6 hours
- Create/Read/Update/Delete
- Basic validation
- List view

**Forms (per complex form):** 3-5 hours
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Success states

**Dashboard/Analytics:** 8-12 hours
- Data visualization
- Real-time updates
- Filtering/sorting

**File Uploads:** 4-6 hours
- Storage setup
- Upload UI
- View/download

**PDF Generation:** 6-8 hours
- Template design
- Data formatting
- Download/email

**Email Notifications:** 4-6 hours
- Email templates
- Trigger logic
- Sending infrastructure

**Integrations (per service):** 10-15 hours
- API setup
- Data mapping
- Error handling
- Testing

**Mobile Responsive:** +20% of total hours
- Responsive design
- Mobile testing
- Touch interactions

## The Buffer Formula

**NEVER give estimates without buffer.**

**Rule of thumb:**
- Base estimate: Sum of feature hours
- Add 25% for unknowns and edge cases
- Add 15% for revisions and client feedback
- Add 10% for testing and bug fixes

**Total: Base × 1.5**

**Example:**
- Base features: 60 hours
- With buffers: 60 × 1.5 = 90 hours
- Tell client: "6-8 weeks" (not "60 hours")

---

## Converting Hours to Timelines

**Full-time work (40 hrs/week):**
- 40 hours of work = 1 week
- 80 hours = 2 weeks
- 120 hours = 3 weeks

**Part-time work (20 hrs/week):**
- 40 hours of work = 2 weeks
- 80 hours = 4 weeks
- 120 hours = 6 weeks

**Always add 1-2 weeks for:**
- Client delays (feedback, access, approvals)
- Holidays/sick days
- Unexpected complexity

**Safe timeline formula:**
(Estimated hours ÷ weekly hours) + 2 weeks

## Project Timeline Breakdown Example

**Fire Inspection Software (80 base hours)**

**Week 1-2: Foundation (20 hours)**
- Project setup
- Database design
- Authentication
- Basic UI framework

**Week 3-4: Core Features (30 hours)**
- Building management
- Inspection scheduling
- User roles

**Week 5-6: Field Features (20 hours)**
- Mobile inspection forms
- Photo uploads
- Data validation

**Week 7: Polish & Testing (10 hours)**
- Bug fixes
- UI refinements
- Testing

**Week 8: Client Review & Revisions**
- Client testing
- Feedback incorporation
- Final adjustments

**Total: 8 weeks** (80 hours × 1.5 buffer ÷ 20 hrs/week = 6 weeks + 2 week buffer)

## Communicating Timelines to Clients

**What to say:**
"Based on the scope, this will take **6-8 weeks** from kickoff to launch."

**What NOT to say:**
"This is 80 hours of work, so if I work full-time it's 2 weeks."

**Why:** Hours mean nothing to clients. Weeks are tangible.

---

## Setting Expectations

**During proposal:**
"Timeline: 6-8 weeks

This assumes:
- You provide feedback within 2 business days
- Access to systems/data is ready
- Scope doesn't change mid-project

If any of those change, timeline adjusts."

**Put it in writing.** Protects you from "why is this taking so long?"

---

## Red Flags That Impact Timeline

❌ **"We need this in 2 weeks"** → Unrealistic for anything substantial
❌ **Unclear requirements** → Will cause delays and rework
❌ **Multiple stakeholders** → Slow approvals
❌ **"Just like [complex SaaS]"** → They underestimate complexity
❌ **Client never responds fast** → Adds weeks to timeline

**Solution:** Build timeline expectations into contract.

---

## When Things Take Longer

**Be honest early:**

"Hi [Client],

Quick update on timeline. We hit an unexpected complexity with [feature]. This is adding 3-5 days to the schedule.

New delivery date: [date] instead of [original date].

Apologies for the delay - I'd rather get it right than rush it.

[Your Name]"

**Better to reset expectations early than miss deadlines.**

---

## Estimation Checklist

Before giving a timeline, verify:
- ✅ All features identified
- ✅ Technical complexity assessed
- ✅ Integration requirements clear
- ✅ Client responsiveness factored in
- ✅ 50% buffer included
- ✅ Testing time included
- ✅ Holidays/vacation accounted for

**If anything is unclear:** Add more buffer or say "I need to scope this more before committing to a timeline."

## The Confidence Matrix

**High Confidence (±1 week):**
- Similar projects done before
- Clear requirements
- No complex integrations
- Responsive client

**Medium Confidence (±2 weeks):**
- Some unknowns
- New tech stack
- Client approval delays possible

**Low Confidence (±4 weeks or "TBD"):**
- Many unknowns
- Complex integrations
- Vague requirements
- Multiple stakeholders

**Adjust buffer accordingly.**

---

## Remember

**Under-promise, over-deliver.**

- Estimate: 6 weeks
- Deliver: 5 weeks
- Client: "Wow, you're fast!"

**vs.**

- Estimate: 3 weeks
- Deliver: 6 weeks
- Client: "Why is this taking so long?"

Same work. Different perception.

**Add buffer. Deliver early. Look like a hero.**
