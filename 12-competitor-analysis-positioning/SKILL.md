# Competitor Analysis & Positioning

Stop losing to SaaS products. Win with positioning.

## What This Skill Does

Input: Your niche + existing SaaS competitors
Output: Gap analysis, positioning strategy, objection handling scripts

## The 4 Positioning Pillars

### 1. Perfect Fit vs. Good Enough
**SaaS:** Built for everyone = perfect for no one
**You:** Built exactly for their workflow

**Script:**
"ServiceTitan is great for large HVAC companies with 50+ technicians. But for a 5-person team like yours, it's overkill. You're paying for features you'll never use. This is built specifically for businesses your size."

### 2. One-Time vs. Recurring
**SaaS:** $200-500/month forever ($12K-$30K over 5 years)
**You:** $15K one-time (own it outright)

**Script:**
"That SaaS costs $300/month. Over 5 years, you'll spend $18K and still not own anything. For $15K, you own this software forever. No monthly fees. After 4 years, you're cashflow positive vs. the SaaS."

### 3. Customizable vs. Rigid
**SaaS:** Their way or the highway
**You:** We adjust to your process

**Script:**
"Most SaaS forces you to change your workflow to fit their software. We build around how you already work. Your team doesn't have to relearn everything."

### 4. Support vs. Ticket Hell
**SaaS:** Submit ticket, wait 2-5 days
**You:** Text/call me directly, fixed in hours

**Script:**
"With SaaS, you're ticket #47,293. With me, you text me directly and I fix it that day. Plus I understand your business - I built this for you."

## Competitive Matrix

| Factor | SaaS Product | Your Solution |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Price** | $300/mo ($18K/5yr) | $15K one-time |
| **Customization** | Rigid | Fully tailored |
| **Support** | Ticket system | Direct access |
| **Setup Time** | 2-4 weeks | 4-6 weeks |
| **Fit** | Generic | Perfect for niche |
| **Ownership** | Rent forever | Own outright |

## When to Recommend SaaS Instead

Be honest - sometimes SaaS is better:

âœ… **Recommend SaaS if:**
- Client budget under $5K
- They need it live in 1 week
- Features are commodity (basic CRM, simple invoicing)
- They want something they can cancel anytime

This builds trust. You're not just trying to sell - you're giving honest advice.

## Gap Analysis Questions

**Ask yourself:**
1. What does SaaS do well? (Don't compete there)
2. What do they miss? (Focus here)
3. What do users complain about? (Read reviews)
4. What's their pricing weakness? (Too expensive? Hidden fees?)
5. What workflow do they not handle? (Your opportunity)

## The "Why Custom" Pitch

"Here's why custom makes sense for you:

**1. Perfect Fit** - SaaS is 70% right. Custom is 100% right.
**2. Own It** - No monthly fees forever. Pay once, own forever.
**3. Your Process** - Built around how you work, not how software thinks you should work.
**4. Direct Support** - Text me when something breaks. Fixed in hours, not days.
**5. Competitive Edge** - Your competitors use generic SaaS. You have software built for your exact advantage.

Yes, custom costs more upfront. But over 3-5 years, you're ahead financially AND operationally."

## Remember

Don't trash competitors. Position yourself as the better fit for their specific situation.

SaaS = good for generic needs
Custom = perfect for specific businesses willing to invest

You're not selling software. You're selling **perfect fit + ownership + support**.
