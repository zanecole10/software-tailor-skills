# Software Pricing Calculator

Stop undercharging. Price your software based on value, not hours.

## What This Skill Does

You describe the software features and complexity, and this skill generates:

✅ **Recommended Pricing** - Specific dollar amounts ($12K, $18K, $35K, etc.)
✅ **Pricing Justification** - Why this price is fair and defensible
✅ **Value-Based Breakdown** - Connect price to business value delivered
✅ **Tiered Pricing Options** - Good/Better/Best packages
✅ **Negotiation Strategies** - How to handle "that's too expensive"
✅ **ROI Calculation** - Proof that software pays for itself
✅ **Payment Terms** - How to structure deposits and milestones

## Who This Is For

**Software Tailors** who need to:
- Price projects confidently without second-guessing
- Charge $15K+ instead of $3K for the same work
- Justify premium prices to skeptical clients
- Structure pricing that captures full value
- Handle price objections professionally
- Avoid the "race to the bottom" with cheap competitors

## How To Use This Skill

### Input Format

Provide project details:

**Example Input:**
```
Project: Fire inspection management software

Features:
- Schedule and assign inspections to field team
- Mobile app for on-site inspection forms
- Photo upload and storage
- PDF report generation with branding
- Automatic reminders for upcoming inspections
- Dashboard showing inspection status
- Client portal to view reports

Business Context:
- Client has 5 inspectors
- Currently manages 200 inspections/month

- Office staff spends 10 hours/week on scheduling
- Client annual revenue: ~$800K

Estimated Build Time: 60-80 hours
```

### Output Format

The skill generates a **comprehensive pricing analysis** like this:

---

## Pricing Analysis: Fire Inspection Management Software

### Recommended Pricing: $18,000

**Payment Structure:**
- 50% ($9,000) deposit upon signing contract
- 25% ($4,500) at MVP completion milestone
- 25% ($4,500) upon final delivery and training

---

### Pricing Justification

#### Why $18,000 is the Right Price

**1. Value-Based Calculation**

**Time Savings:**
- 5 inspectors × 2 hours/day paperwork = 10 hours/day wasted
- 10 hours × 22 workdays = 220 hours/month saved
- At $30/hour labor cost = **$6,600/month saved**

**Office Staff Savings:**
- 10 hours/week scheduling × 4 weeks = 40 hours/month
- At $25/hour = **$1,000/month saved**

**Total Monthly Savings: $7,600**
**Annual Savings: $91,200**

**Software pays for itself in:** 2.4 months ✅

---

**2. Revenue Protection**

**Problem:** Manual tracking causes missed inspections → client churn

**Impact:**
- Average client value: $5,000/year
- If you lose just 2 clients/year due to poor service = **$10,000 lost revenue**
- Preventing even 2 lost clients pays for the software

---

**3. Growth Enabler**

**Current Bottleneck:** Can't scale beyond 200 inspections/month without hiring more office staff

**With Software:**
- Same team can handle 400+ inspections/month
- Each additional inspection = $250 revenue
- 100 extra inspections/month = **$25,000 extra monthly revenue**
- **$300,000 annual revenue increase potential**

$18K investment → $300K growth opportunity = **16x ROI**

---

**4. Competitive Analysis**

**Off-the-shelf alternatives:**
- ServiceTitan: $300-500/month = $3,600-6,000/year (not customized)
- FieldPulse: $100-250/month = $1,200-3,000/year (limited features)
- Building custom = $18,000 one-time (perfect fit, no monthly fees)

**Custom beats SaaS after:** 3-5 years, AND it's tailored to your exact workflow

---

**5. Complexity & Risk Factors**

**Build Complexity:**
- Multi-user system with role-based permissions
- Mobile-responsive interface
- File upload and storage
- PDF generation engine
- Automated notification system
- Real-time dashboard with analytics
- Secure client portal

**Estimated Build Time:** 60-80 hours
**At $150-200/hour development rate** → $9,000-16,000 cost basis

**$18,000 = Fair market rate** for this complexity level

---

### ROI Presentation Script

**Use this when presenting pricing to client:**

> "Let me show you why this investment makes sense...
>
> Right now, your team is spending 220 hours per month on manual paperwork and scheduling. That's $7,600 in labor costs every single month.
>
> This software eliminates that waste. You'll save $91,000 per year in labor costs alone.
>
> The $18,000 investment pays for itself in just 2.4 months. After that, it's pure profit.
>
> Plus, you mentioned you've been turning down work because your current system can't handle more volume. This unlocks the ability to grow from 200 to 400+ inspections per month without hiring more office staff.
>
> That's $300,000 in additional annual revenue potential.
>
> So the real question isn't 'Can we afford $18,000?' It's 'Can we afford NOT to fix this problem?' Every month you wait costs you $7,600 in wasted labor and missed growth opportunities."

### Handling Price Objections

#### Objection #1: "That's more than we expected to spend."

**Response:**
"I understand - $18K is a significant investment. Let me ask: what were you expecting to spend, and what did you think you'd get for that amount?"

**Then:** Educate on the difference between custom software and cheap templates.

**Reframe:**
"Think of this as hiring a full-time employee for 2 months at no salary, just results. If I told you I could permanently solve your scheduling problem for the equivalent of 2 months of salary, that's a steal."

---

#### Objection #2: "Can't we just use [SaaS product]?"

**Response:**
"Great question! Let's compare...

[SaaS Product] costs $300/month and includes [generic features]. Over 5 years, you'll spend $18,000 and still not have the exact workflow you need.

Custom software is $18,000 one-time and does exactly what you need, exactly how you need it. After 5 years, you've spent the same amount but you own the software outright.

Plus, [SaaS Product] doesn't have [specific feature client needs]. We build that in from day one."

---

#### Objection #3: "We need to think about it."

**Response:**
"Absolutely - this is a big decision. What specifically do you need to think about? Budget? Features? Timeline?"

**Uncover the real objection,** then address it directly.

**Create urgency:**
"I get it. Just keep in mind - every month you delay costs you $7,600 in wasted labor. Waiting 3 months to 'think about it' means $22,800 down the drain. Sometimes the riskier decision is doing nothing."

---

#### Objection #4: "Can you do it for $10K?"

**Response:**
"I appreciate you have a budget in mind. Here's what I can do...

For $10K, I can deliver the Core System [reference Option 1]. That gives you the foundation and solves your biggest pain points.

Then, if you want the automated reminders, advanced dashboard, and client notifications [Option 2 features], we can add those in Phase 2 for an additional $6K.

Or, we can start with $18K for the complete solution so you don't have to come back and pay more later. Which approach makes more sense for you?"

### Pricing Psychology Tips

#### Anchor High
- Present the highest-priced option first
- Makes middle option feel reasonable
- "Premium Package: $28K. Or, if you prefer, the Complete Solution at $18K..."

#### Use Odd Numbers
- $17,950 feels cheaper than $18,000
- Implies precision, not arbitrary rounding

#### Never Say "Only" or "Just"
- ❌ "It's just $18K"
- ✅ "The investment is $18,000"
- Own the price confidently

#### Compare to Costs They Already Pay
- "Less than one month of salary for your office manager"
- "Same cost as that truck you just bought"
- Makes software feel small by comparison

#### Show Cost of Inaction
- "Every month you wait costs $7,600 in wasted labor"
- Fear of loss motivates more than promise of gain

---

### Red Flags (When to Walk Away)

**Clients who say:**
- ❌ "Can you start work before we sign a contract?" → No legal protection
- ❌ "We'll pay you after we start making money from it" → Spec work trap
- ❌ "Just give me a number, I'll decide if it's worth it" → Doesn't value your expertise
- ❌ "My nephew can build this for $500" → Delusional, will waste your time
- ❌ "We need it done by next week" → Unrealistic expectations

**When revenue doesn't justify price:**
- Client revenue < $200K/year, asking for $30K software → They can't afford it
- B2C products (they want to resell your software) → Different pricing model
- "Build it and we'll pay you a % of revenue" → Almost never works

---

### Confidence Builders

**When you doubt yourself, remember:**

✅ **Your time is valuable** - Even at 80 hours × $150/hour = $12K+ is fair
✅ **You're solving real problems** - Worth more than your hourly rate
✅ **Custom beats off-the-shelf** - They're paying for perfect fit
✅ **They contacted you** - They already know they need help
✅ **ROI justifies price** - If it saves them $91K/year, $18K is cheap

**Practice saying your price out loud without flinching:**
"The investment for the complete solution is eighteen thousand dollars."

Say it confidently. Own it. It's worth it.

---

## Summary

### Pricing Formula

**Price = (Hours × $150-250/hour) + Value Multiplier**

**Value Multiplier:**
- How much money/time does it save?
- How much revenue does it unlock?
- How badly do they need it?
- What's their ability to pay?

### Quick Reference

| Project Complexity | Build Time | Price Range |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Simple            | 20-40 hrs | $5K-$10K    |
| Medium            | 50-100 hrs| $10K-$20K   |
| Complex           | 100-200 hrs| $20K-$40K  |
| Enterprise        | 200+ hrs  | $40K-$100K+ |

### Remember

You're not selling hours - you're selling **transformation**. Price based on the value you create, not the time it takes to create it.

A $15K fire inspection system that saves $91K/year is a steal. Charge accordingly.
