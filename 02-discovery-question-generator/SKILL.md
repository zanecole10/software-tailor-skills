## How to Use These Questions

### During the Discovery Call

**Don't ask all 50 questions** - That's overwhelming. Instead:

1. **Start with Workflow questions** (Category 1) to get them talking naturally
2. **Follow the conversation** - Let their answers guide which categories to explore
3. **Dig deeper** when they mention pain points: "Tell me more about that", "How often does that happen?"
4. **Listen for emotion** - Frustration, anger, stress = expensive problems they'll pay to solve
5. **Quantify everything** - "How many hours?", "How much does that cost?", "How often?"

### Red Flags (Questions that disqualify prospects)

- Annual revenue under $500K → Likely can't afford $15K
- "We need this to be under $2K" → Wrong budget expectation
- "I need to think about it for a few months" → No urgency
- "We're just exploring options" → Tire-kicker, not ready to buy

### Green Flags (Questions that indicate ready buyers)

- "How soon can you start?" → Urgency
- "What if we wanted to add [feature]?" → Thinking about expansion
- "We're currently wasting 20 hours a week on this" → Quantified pain
- "I can make this decision myself" → Authority

## Question Frameworks

### The Time Waste Question
"How many hours per week does your team spend on [manual process]?"
- Reveals cost of problem
- Creates urgency
- Builds ROI justification

### The Magic Wand Question
"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing, what would it be?"
- Gets to core desire
- Reveals highest-value feature
- Opens up dream scenario conversation

### The Failure Story Question
"Tell me about the last time [process] went wrong. What happened?"
- Gets emotional response
- Reveals real-world consequences
- Creates fear of inaction

### The Growth Blocker Question
"If you wanted to double your business, what would break first?"
- Reveals scalability needs
- Creates vision of future growth
- Justifies investment now

### The Cost of Inaction Question
"If you don't solve this problem, what happens in 6 months?"
- Creates urgency
- Reveals true cost
- Motivates decision

## Adapting Questions to Different Industries

This skill generates industry-specific questions, but the underlying frameworks apply across all businesses:

**Service Businesses** (HVAC, Plumbing, Inspections)
- Focus on: Scheduling, dispatch, route optimization, client communication

**Retail/Inventory** (Shops, Warehouses)
- Focus on: Inventory tracking, supplier management, sales reporting

**Professional Services** (Law, Accounting, Consulting)
- Focus on: Client management, time tracking, document organization

**Healthcare** (Clinics, Physical Therapy)
- Focus on: Patient scheduling, records management, billing

**Construction/Trades** (Contractors, Builders)
- Focus on: Job tracking, material management, crew scheduling

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Ask open-ended questions that get them talking
- ✅ Listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- ✅ Take detailed notes on pain points
- ✅ Quantify everything in hours and dollars
- ✅ Ask "Why?" and "Tell me more" to dig deeper
- ✅ Let silence happen - don't fill every pause

### DON'T:
- ❌ Pitch solutions before understanding the problem
- ❌ Ask yes/no questions - they shut down conversation
- ❌ Lead the witness ("Wouldn't it be great if...")
- ❌ Skip budget qualification questions
- ❌ Assume you understand without asking

## After the Discovery Call

### Synthesize Findings

1. **List top 3-5 pain points** they mentioned
2. **Calculate cost of problems** (hours × hourly rate)
3. **Identify must-have features** vs. nice-to-haves
4. **Draft software blueprint** using the Business Problem to Blueprint skill
5. **Prepare proposal** with ROI calculation

### Follow-Up

Send a summary email:
- Thank them for their time
- Recap the problems you heard
- Preview your solution approach
- Schedule next call to present proposal

## Remember

The goal of discovery questions isn't to interrogate - it's to **understand their world deeply** so you can build software that solves their real problems. The best software tailors ask questions that make prospects say: "Wow, you really get our business."

Good questions lead to great software. Great software gets $15K+ price tags.
