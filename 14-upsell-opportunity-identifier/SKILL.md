# Upsell Opportunity Identifier

Turn $15K clients into $30K+ clients with strategic upsells.

## What This Skill Does

Input: Completed project + client usage patterns
Output: Upsell opportunities, pricing, pitch scripts

## When to Upsell

**Best Timing:**
✅ 30-60 days after launch (they're using it daily)
✅ After they express satisfaction ("This is working great!")
✅ When they mention new pain points
✅ During renewal conversations (if recurring support)

**Bad Timing:**
❌ During initial project (looks greedy)
❌ When they're frustrated with bugs
❌ Before they see ROI

## Upsell Categories

### 1. Phase 2 Features (Already Discussed)
**Opportunity:** Features you identified during discovery but saved for later

**Example - Fire Inspection Software:**
- MVP: Inspection scheduling + mobile forms
- Upsell: PDF reports + automated notifications + client portal
- Price: $6K-$8K

**Pitch:**
"You've been using the system for a month - how's it going? 

I remember you mentioned wanting automated PDF reports and a client portal. Now that the core system is working great, want to add those features? 

Would take 2-3 weeks, $7K total."

---

### 2. New Pain Points (Discovered After Launch)
**Opportunity:** Problems they didn't know they had until using the software

**Example:**
- They're manually creating invoices from completed inspections
- Upsell: Automatic invoice generation + payment tracking
- Price: $3K-$5K

**Pitch:**
"I noticed you're still manually creating invoices after inspections. Want me to automate that? You'd save 5-10 hours/week and get paid faster."

---

### 3. Integrations (Connect to Other Tools)
**Opportunity:** They're using other software that could connect

**Common Integrations:**
- QuickBooks (accounting)
- Stripe (payments)
- Twilio (SMS notifications)
- Zapier (connect to anything)

**Price:** $2K-$5K per integration

**Pitch:**
"Are you using QuickBooks for accounting? I can connect the software so invoices sync automatically. No more double-entry. Interested?"

---

### 4. Mobile App (Native iOS/Android)
**Opportunity:** Field workers want better mobile experience

**Price:** $8K-$15K

**Pitch:**
"Your inspectors love the mobile web version. But a native app would be even better - faster, works offline, app store presence. Worth exploring?"

**Warning:** Only suggest if they have 10+ mobile users. Otherwise mobile web is enough.

---

### 5. Advanced Features (Power User Requests)
**Opportunity:** They want to do more with data

**Examples:**
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Custom reporting
- Role-based permissions (more granular)
- Audit logs
- Data export/backup features

**Price:** $3K-$8K depending on complexity

---

### 6. Training & Documentation
**Opportunity:** New employees need to learn the system

**Package:**
- Video tutorials (15-20 min)
- Written user guides
- Live onboarding session for new hires

**Price:** $1,500-$2,500

**Pitch:**
"You mentioned hiring 2 new inspectors. Want me to create training materials so they can get up to speed quickly?"

---

### 7. White-Label / Resell Rights
**Opportunity:** Client wants to resell your software to others

**Price:** $10K-$30K + revenue share OR higher upfront license fee

**Pitch:**
"Other fire inspection companies ask you how you manage inspections so well. What if you could sell them this software? I can white-label it for you, you resell it and keep a margin."

**Advanced play:** Turn one client into a distribution channel

---

## Upsell Math

**Scenario:**
- Original project: $15K
- 30 days later: $7K Phase 2 upsell
- 60 days later: $3K QuickBooks integration
- 90 days later: $1.5K training materials
- **Total:** $26.5K from one client

**Plus monthly support:** $1K/month × 12 = $12K/year recurring

**One client = $38.5K first year**

Do this with 5 clients = $192.5K/year revenue

---

## The Upsell Conversation Framework

**Step 1: Check-In**
"Hey [Name], how's the software working for you?"

*Listen for satisfaction signals*

**Step 2: Observe Pain Point**
"I noticed you're still doing [manual process]. That's costing you time."

**Step 3: Present Solution**
"I can automate that. Would take [timeline], cost [price]."

**Step 4: Tie to ROI**
"This saves [hours/week]. At your labor cost, pays for itself in [timeframe]."

**Step 5: Easy Close**
"Want me to send a quick proposal?"

---

## Red Flags (Don't Upsell If...)

❌ They're unhappy with current software
❌ They haven't paid final invoice yet
❌ Bugs aren't fixed
❌ They're cash-strapped
❌ They haven't actually used the software much

Fix the foundation before building on top.

## Proactive Upsell Strategy

**Don't wait for them to ask. Identify opportunities and pitch.**

**Monthly Review:**
1. Check usage data (what features do they use most?)
2. Identify manual processes still happening
3. Think "what's the next logical enhancement?"
4. Pitch 1-2 upsells per client per quarter

**Conversion Rate:**
- 30-50% of satisfied clients will buy Phase 2
- 20-30% will buy integrations or add-ons
- 10-20% will buy advanced features

---

## Remember

**Upselling existing clients is:**
- ✅ Easier than finding new clients
- ✅ Higher conversion rate (they already trust you)
- ✅ More profitable (less sales time)
- ✅ Builds relationship depth

**Formula:**
1 client × $15K initial + $15K upsells = $30K lifetime value

vs.

2 new clients × $15K each = $30K but 2x the sales effort

**Work smarter. Upsell existing clients.**
