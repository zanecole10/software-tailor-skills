# Proposal & Contract Generator

Win clients with professional proposals. Protect yourself with clear contracts.

## What This Skill Does

Input project details → Get complete professional package:
✅ **Project Proposal** - Compelling pitch document
✅ **Scope of Work** - Detailed deliverables
✅ **Payment Terms** - 50% deposit structure, milestones
✅ **Timeline** - Realistic delivery schedule
✅ **Contract Template** - Simple, enforceable agreement

## Standard Proposal Structure

**1. Executive Summary**
- Project overview in 2-3 sentences
- Key benefits to client
- Total investment and timeline

**2. Problem Statement**
- Current challenges client faces
- Cost of not solving (hours wasted, revenue lost)

**3. Proposed Solution**
- What you'll build
- Key features and benefits
- How it solves their problem

**4. Deliverables**
- Specific items client receives
- Acceptance criteria

**5. Timeline & Milestones**
- Week-by-week breakdown
- Key delivery dates

**6. Investment**
- Total project cost
- Payment schedule
- What's included

**7. Next Steps**
- Sign proposal
- Pay deposit
- Kick off project

## Payment Terms (Standard)

**50/25/25 Structure:**
- 50% ($9,000) - Upon signing (secures commitment)
- 25% ($4,500) - At MVP completion (mid-project validation)
- 25% ($4,500) - Upon final delivery (incentive to finish strong)

**Why this works:** Client has skin in game, you're protected from scope creep, final payment motivates completion.

## Simple Contract Template

Include these sections:
- **Parties:** You and client
- **Scope:** What you're building
- **Timeline:** Delivery dates
- **Payment:** Terms and schedule
- **IP Ownership:** Client owns code after final payment
- **Termination:** How either party can exit
- **Changes:** How scope changes are handled
- **Warranty:** 30-day bug fix guarantee

**Keep it simple** - 2-3 pages max. Complex contracts scare clients.

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ "We'll pay you after we make money from it"
❌ "Can you start before we sign?"
❌ "Just send an invoice, we don't need a contract"
❌ Payment terms longer than 90 days
❌ "My lawyer needs to review this" (for $15K projects)

## Remember

Professional proposals win $15K deals. DIY Google Docs lose to competitors. Invest 2 hours in a great proposal template - use it 100 times.
