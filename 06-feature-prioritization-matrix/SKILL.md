# Feature Prioritization Matrix

Turn feature chaos into structured, profitable delivery phases.

## What This Skill Does

You list all features a client wants, and this skill outputs:

✅ **MVP Features** - Must-have for launch (what to build first)
✅ **Phase 2 Features** - Enhanced functionality (post-launch additions)
✅ **Phase 3+ Features** - Nice-to-haves (future roadmap)
✅ **Estimated Build Time** - Realistic hours per phase
✅ **Pricing Structure** - How to charge for phased delivery
✅ **Priority Reasoning** - Why each feature belongs in its phase

## Who This Is For

**Software Tailors** need to prevent scope creep, keep projects manageable, create upsell opportunities, set realistic expectations, and deliver value quickly.

## Prioritization Framework

### MVP (Phase 1) - Must-Have
- Solves core problem
- Blocking other features
- Can't launch without it
- Simple to build

### Phase 2 - Should-Have
- Significantly improves UX
- Automates manual processes
- Clear ROI
- Client proven they use MVP

### Phase 3 - Nice-to-Have
- Competitive differentiator
- Efficiency optimization
- Not urgent

### Future - Maybe Someday
- Expensive to build
- Adds recurring costs
- Unclear ROI

## Presenting Phased Delivery

"I organized features into phases so you see working software in 6 weeks, not 6 months. Phase 1 ($18K) solves your core problem. Phase 2 ($7K) adds automation after you've proven you love it. Phase 3 ($10K) gives you competitive edge. You only commit to $18K today - if Phase 1 doesn't work, you stop. If it's amazing, you invest more."

## Preventing Scope Creep

When client says "Can we just add...?":

"Great idea! [Feature X] takes [Y] hours. Three options:
1. Add to Phase 2 for $[Z]
2. Swap for something in MVP
3. Expand MVP: add $[Z] and push timeline [W] weeks

Which makes sense?"

**Never "just add" features for free.**
