## How to Present Packages

**After delivery, during training:**

"The software is built and working great. Here's what I recommend for ongoing support...

**You have three options:**

**Option 1: No Support Package**
- You can email me if something breaks, I'll fix it on a project basis
- Typically $150/hour for fixes or updates
- Unpredictable costs, slower response times

**Option 2: Basic Support ($500/month)**
- I fix any bugs within 4 hours
- Includes 2 hours/month for small updates
- Predictable monthly cost

**Option 3: Professional Support ($1,000/month) - MOST POPULAR**
- Priority support, 5 hours/month of updates
- Perfect for businesses that want to keep improving the software

Most of my clients go with Professional. It's like having a developer on retainer without the $75K salary."

## What to Include

**Bug Fixes:** Always included (it should work as promised)
**Feature Requests:** Bill hourly or include monthly quota
**Hosting Costs:** Pass through to client or bundle into package
**Updates/Security:** Include in all packages (protects your work)

## Pricing Strategy

**Formula:** Monthly package = 5-10% of original project cost

- $15K project → $750-$1,500/month packages
- $30K project → $1,500-$3,000/month packages

## Why Clients Buy Maintenance Packages

✅ **Peace of mind** - Someone to call when things break
✅ **Predictable costs** - $1K/month vs uncertain hourly bills
✅ **Continuous improvement** - Software gets better over time
✅ **Priority access** - Their requests don't wait in line

## Why YOU Want Recurring Revenue

✅ **Predictable income** - $5K/month recurring = financial stability
✅ **Easier than new clients** - Existing clients already trust you
✅ **Compound growth** - Each project adds recurring revenue
✅ **Higher business valuation** - Recurring revenue = 5-10x annual value

**Math:** 
- 5 clients × $1K/month = $5K/month = $60K/year recurring
- 10 clients × $1K/month = $10K/month = $120K/year recurring
- That's a real business, not project-to-project hustle

## How to Upsell Support Packages

**Timing:** 30 days after delivery (once they're using it daily)

**Email:**
"Hi [Client],

It's been a month since we launched [Software]. How's it going?

I wanted to follow up about ongoing support. Right now, if something breaks or you need changes, it's billed hourly at $150/hour.

Many of my clients prefer a support package instead - predictable monthly cost, faster response times, and included development hours for improvements.

I have three tiers: Basic ($500/mo), Professional ($1K/mo), and Premium ($2K/mo).

Want to hop on a 15-min call to discuss what makes sense for you?"

**Conversion Rate:** 30-50% of clients will buy some level of support

## Remember

One-time projects = unpredictable income, constant hustle for new clients

Recurring revenue = stability, compounding growth, real business

Offer support packages to every client. Even if only 3 out of 10 buy, that's $3K/month recurring revenue.
