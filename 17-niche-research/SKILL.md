## Research Framework

When you activate this skill with a niche, it systematically analyzes:

### 2. Biggest Problems & Pain Points

**Operational Problems:**
- What manual processes waste their time?

- What breaks often in their workflow?
- What causes scheduling chaos?
- What data do they lose or can't find?

**Financial Pain:**
- What costs them the most money?
- What revenue do they lose due to inefficiency?
- What mistakes cost them clients?

**Customer/Client Issues:**

- What creates bad reviews?
- What causes clients to leave?
- What makes communication difficult?
- What delays hurt their reputation?

**Technology Frustrations:**

### 3. Language & Lingo Analysis

**Industry Jargon:**
- Technical terms they use daily
- Acronyms specific to the field
- Brand names as verbs (e.g., "Xerox this")
- Slang and shortcuts

**Pain Language:**
- How do they describe problems?
- What metaphors do they use?
- What do they call their current broken systems?
- What phrases signal frustration?

**Desired Outcome Language:**
- How do they describe success?
- What results do they brag about?
- What metrics matter to them?
- What would make their life easier?

**Example (Fire Inspectors):**
- "Running inspections" not "conducting assessments"
- "In the field" not "on-site"
- "Writing up violations" not "documenting non-compliance"
- "My route" not "my schedule"

This language becomes your sales copy, your discovery questions, your demo script.

**Example (Dentist Office):**

## Example: Music Venue Niche Research

**Input:** "Research the music venue market"

**Output:**

### 1. Industry Overview
- ~10,000 music venues in the US
- Average revenue: $500K-$2M/year
- Trend: Consolidation by Live Nation/AEG, independents struggling

### 2. Where They Hang Out
- **Forums:** VenueConnection.com, Pollstar forums
- **Reddit:** r/musicvenue, r/livesound, r/eventpros
- **Facebook Groups:** "Music Venue Owners & Operators" (4.2K members)
- **Industry Sites:** Pollstar.com, VenueNow.com
- **Events:** INTIX Conference, Venue Connect Summit

### 3. Top 10 Pain Points
1. **Double-bookings** - Artists confirm, venue accidentally books another artist same night
2. **Contract chaos** - Paper contracts lost, unsigned deals, he-said-she-said disputes
3. **No-show artists** - Lost revenue, angry ticket holders
4. **Ticketing platform fees** - Eventbrite takes 10%+, eats into already thin margins
5. **Cash flow gaps** - Artists want deposit, venue doesn't get ticket money until after show
6. **Marketing fragmentation** - Managing Facebook, Instagram, email, website separately
7. **Capacity tracking** - Fire marshal limits, manual counting at door
8. **Rider compliance** - Forgetting M&Ms for band = angry artist
9. **Staff scheduling** - Last-minute bartender cancellations
10. **Data scattered everywhere** - Excel for one thing, Google Sheets for another, email for contracts

### 4. Language Dictionary
- **Industry Terms:** "Load-in time," "door time," "curfew," "rider," "backline," "sound check"
- **Pain Phrases:** "We double-booked again," "Artist ghosted us," "Eventbrite is killing our margin"
- **Success Phrases:** "Sold out show," "Perfect load-in," "Artist wants to come back"
- **Avoid:** "Concert" (they say "show"), "Revenue optimization" (they say "making money"), "CRM" (too corporate)

### 5. Keeps Them Up at Night
- Will this show actually happen or will artist cancel?
- Am I going to get sued over a contract dispute?
- Will I sell enough tickets to break even?
- Is my venue going to get bought out by LiveNation?
- Can I afford to keep the lights on this year?

### 6. Dream Outcome
- "I want artists to see my venue as the best-run room in the city"
- "I want sold-out shows without spending $1K on Facebook ads"
- "I want to book 3 months out with zero double-bookings"
- "I want my staff to know exactly what to do without me micromanaging"
- "I want to make 15% margin instead of 5%"

### 7. Market Gaps
- No all-in-one booking + ticketing + contracts + marketing platform under $500/month
- Existing tools (Prism, Artifax) are $800-$1500/month - too expensive for small venues
- No good mobile app for door staff to scan tickets + track capacity
- No integration between booking calendar and social media posting
- No artist CRM (tracking past shows, what they drew, would they rebook)

### 8. Big Changes Coming
- **Regulation:** Some cities requiring digital ticket sales records for tax compliance
- **Technology:** Artists expect professional online booking (no more email back-and-forth)
- **Economic:** Margins shrinking, forcing venues to cut costs (software = automation)
- **Generational:** Younger venue owners expect tech, won't tolerate Excel spreadsheets

### 9. Perfect Software Solution

**Core Problem Solved:** Eliminate double-bookings and contract chaos

**MVP Features:**
- Booking calendar with conflict detection
- Digital contracts (artist signs online, auto-stored)
- Ticketing with low fees (undercut Eventbrite)
- Capacity tracking (live count at door)
- Artist CRM (past shows, would they rebook, contact info)

**Phase 2 Features:**
- Social media auto-posting when show is booked
- Email marketing for ticket buyers
- Staff scheduling for show nights
- Rider checklist (don't forget the M&Ms)

**Integrations:**
- QuickBooks (for accounting)
- Mailchimp (for email marketing)
- Instagram/Facebook (auto-post shows)

**Pricing:** $15K one-time build OR $200/month SaaS
- **ROI Justification:** Prevents one $5K lawsuit from contract dispute = paid for itself
- **Eventbrite Comparison:** Saving 10% on $200K/year in ticket sales = $20K saved, software pays for itself in <1 year

**Positioning:** "The only venue management system built specifically for independent music venues under 1,000 capacity"

### 10. Go-to-Market Plan

**Where to Find Prospects:**
- Facebook Group: "Music Venue Owners & Operators"
- Reddit: r/musicvenue (post case study)
- Cold email: Scrape venue websites in target cities
- Industry events: Venue Connect Summit (booth/sponsor)

**Opening Message:**
"Hey [Name], I built a system that eliminates double-bookings and contract chaos for music venues. Interested in seeing how [Venue Name] could book 3 months out with zero conflicts?"

**Proof Needed:**
- Video demo of booking calendar + conflict detection
- Sample digital contract
- Comparison: Eventbrite fees vs. our ticketing
- Testimonial from first venue client

**Expected Objections + Responses:**
- **"We already use Prism"** → "How much are you paying? We're $200/month vs $1,200. What features would you miss?"
- **"We've always done it this way"** → "How many double-bookings did you have last year? Each one costs you a show."
- **"Can't afford it"** → "You're losing 10% to Eventbrite fees. On $200K in tickets, that's $20K/year. Our software is $2,400/year."

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Before targeting a new industry** - Become an expert fast
✅ **Before discovery calls** - Know their pain before they say it
✅ **Before building software** - Ensure you're solving real problems
✅ **Before cold outreach** - Speak their language perfectly
✅ **Before pricing a project** - Understand their ROI thresholds

❌ **Don't use if you already deeply know the niche** - Trust your expertise
❌ **Don't use for super broad markets** - "Small businesses" is too vague, pick a specific niche

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Go Narrow, Not Wide
- "Dentists" is broad → "Pediatric dentists in suburban areas" is better
- "Contractors" is broad → "Residential HVAC contractors with 5-15 employees" is better

### 2. Look for Complaint Threads
Reddit posts titled:
- "Why does [tool] suck so bad?"
- "What do you hate most about your job?"
- "Unpopular opinion: [rant]"

These are GOLD for pain points.

### 3. Find the "Watering Holes"
Where do they go when they need help?
- Facebook groups (ask questions)
- Forums (troubleshooting)
- YouTube (tutorials)

Those are where you show up with your solution.

### 4. Steal Their Language
Copy-paste actual phrases from forums/Reddit into:
- Your cold emails
- Your discovery questions
- Your sales copy

If they say "I'm drowning in paperwork," you say "Tired of drowning in paperwork?" not "Optimize your workflow."

### 5. Validate Before Building
After the research, reach out to 5-10 people in the niche and ask:
- "Is [pain point] actually a problem for you?"
- "Would you pay $X to solve it?"
- "What have you tried so far?"

Research gets you 80% there. Validation gets you to 100%.

## Remember

**This skill doesn't replace talking to real people.**

It gives you a massive head start so that when you DO talk to them, you:
- Ask the right questions
- Speak their language
- Understand their world
- Position your solution perfectly

**You go from outsider to insider in 30 minutes.**

Then you validate with real conversations, build the perfect solution, and close deals.

**Market research isn't about being smart. It's about listening where your competitors aren't.**
